# Project V2 - Cognitive Services

**Deadline?**

* during the exams period?

**Pipeline:**

1.  acquire data, clean
2.  load or find features manually to classify
3.  visualize image features for each image to check it's working in a right way
4.  build visual vocabolary with quantity of features for each image

**TODO:**
* classify using Custom Vision Microsoft(customvision.ai) 
* classify with Tensorflow model built with Lobe
* classify with Clarifai (clarifai.com)
* port Tensorflow model to JS version https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter
* look at Modeldepot
* construct function that load image and give the related predicted class
* serve with AWS serverless of cloud functions for the pb model

**Possible goals:**
* understanding more the model horizontally too from Tensorboard(http://asus-ux310gio:6006/#graphs&run=.)
* might be usefuel to use a GAN or randomize images and black and white them

**Possible datasets:**
* 5 types of flowers
* 4 types of blood cells
