**Extra goals:**

* test GAN to randomize images of specific types
* turn all images to black and white to remove bias?
* port Tensorflow model to JS version https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter

  * first convert pb to Saved Model with ckpt and meta, is it possible?

* understanding more the model with Tensorboard
  * to run Tensorboard run 'tensorboard --logdir=./log', url (http://asus-ux310gio:6006/#graphs&run=.)
* understand which kind of model the microsoft team is using to build models fast in customvision
* look at Modeldepot
* classify with Tensorflow model built with Lobe

**Possible datasets:**

* 5 types of flowers
* 4 types of blood cells

**API call:**
https://southcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v2.0/Training/projects/bd1adee5-8e9e-4fe2-a0d8-ea275b91e2be/iterations/e39b2666-938d-4b45-8045-2c548ba2b1ad/export

fine grained datasets -> 17 types of flowers

fine tuning

cutting the FC makes the CNN act as a feature extractor and by using really complex ones who has been trained for ages you get good results with short training time
